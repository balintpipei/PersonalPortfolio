                    At this moment I decided that I should use my knowledge. I always loved the IT courses at the university so I thought the programming world would be the best choice for me.

                    Help dealing with different type of costumers and issues. I had to handle plenty of complex computer programmes such as Siebel, R2, KTN, CSR and I showed these how to work properly to my new colleges by training them. I have been trained for Broadband, TV, Phone and some part of Mobile services. I also studied the SAT, KOAX, IP and OPTIC systems. This IT knowledge helped me later on to improve my problem solving skills.
